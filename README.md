# FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller with Emergency Vehicle Priority

This project simulates a traffic light controller for a 4-way intersection using Verilog HDL, with emergency vehicle priority override for both North-South and East-West directions.

## Features
- FSM-based traffic signal logic
- Emergency override input for NS and EW directions
- Clock divider for timing control
- Testbench for simulation

## Files
- `traffic_controller.v`: Main controller module
- `clock_divider.v`: Slows down system clock
- `testbench.v`: Simulation with emergency input test cases

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado / ModelSim
- FPGA Board: Xilinx Spartan (example)
